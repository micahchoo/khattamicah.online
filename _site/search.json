      "content"  : "Meta:  Author: Ella Myers    - Citation:          intext: (Myers, 2013)      bibliography: Myers, E. (2013). Worldly ethics: Democratic Politics and Care for the World (pp. 85-110). Duke University Press.      Quotes:  Theorists such as Connolly, Critchley, and Butler are right to insist that democratic practice is irreducible to formal structures of government; it is always shaped by the          dispositions, habits of mind, affective comportments, and felt commitments of its participants (and nonparticipants).    - Care for the world, distinct from concern for oneself or for an Other, is an ethos uniquely fit for democratic life.1    - The practitioner of such care is never a self but always an association of selves. Even more important, the recipient of care is not another person or even persons, but the world, understood as the array of material and immaterial conditions under which human beings live—both with one another and with a rich variety of nonhumans, organic and technological.    - More specifically still, coaction among citizens is directed not at the world per se but at particular worldly things that become objects of shared attention and concern. This thing, a concept that, like world, awaits full theorization, is crucial to every democratic undertaking. It is the third term—a practice, place, law, habit, or event— around which people gather, both in solidarity and division.    - supports and inspires mutual care for worldly conditions.    - giving of attention,    - expressed in action.    - caring about and caring for something.    - Hannah Arendt’s notion of amor mundi, or love of the world.    - the complex, extrasubjective “web”    - when people combine together to tend not to themselves but to the world in which they live.3    - care as intimate, suggesting both that care can be undertaken collectively by an association of actors and also that care can at times mean caring for objects and environments as well as people.8    - democratic mode of care, associative in character and oriented    - toward worldly things.    - That is, although caring for oneself, others, and the world have something in common—signaled by the presence of the term care—they are far from identical or even mutually supportive activities.    - Democratic care for the world, for example, though not unrelated to the fulfillment of people’s needs, may involve, paradoxically, displacing immediately vulnerable people from the center of analysis in order to bring into view and work to transform the complex environment out of which their needs arise.    - The world is not strictly tangible. Its materiality, what can be seen and touched, is never isolated from languages, relationships, norms, habits, and traditions, the more intangible elements of existence that overlie the physical.    - “The things that owe their existence exclusively to men nonetheless constantly condition their human makers.”16    - \"The world, in short, should be understood as highly susceptible to human decision making and activity. \"    - World displaces human beings from the center of analysis and brings into view a complex material and immaterial assemblage that is irreducible to human beings themselves. Although the world is never simply an inert background, it is the site and context of human action, among many other things. And worldly conditions, many of them produced, sustained, and altered by human actors, are nonetheless distinguishable from those actors themselves.20 Naming the world is important because it brings into focus a complex, heterogeneous entity that is distinct from any human being or collection of human beings.    - The focus of their attention, that “something” else, is a feature of the world. And, as Arendt points out, the world is “that about which we speak” when we address one another as citizens.22 The world, or rather some element of it, is the reason citizens struggle with and against each other.    - although the specific motivations and sentiments that inspire collective democratic action vary widely and produce outcomes that are uncertain, an underlying impulse, the “wish to change the world,” is shared by even the most divergent democratic actors.23    - “affair or matter of pertinence” that drew people together in delibera-tion, denoting what concerned human beings and was therefore a “matter for discourse.” The original meaning of thing as assembly and its later nam-ing of a “matter of pertinence” are a reminder that whether citizens are acting cooperatively on behalf of a shared goal or struggling against one another in pursuit of competing projects, their relations are mediated by the presence of a third term, a feature of the world that concerns or “bears upon” them.25 Worldly things, the objects of associative democratic action, are defined by three principal features: they are multiple, fluctuating, and con-tested.    - First, rather than thinking of the world as the focal point of demo-cratic efforts, it is illuminating to consider the vast array of worldly things that have been and can become objects of political attention and advocacy.    - a matter of fact—a relatively unproblematic feature of existence—is reconfigured as important,changeable, and demanding of public attention, that is, a matter of concern.    - collective organizing by ordinary citi-zens who seek to challenge existing arrangements as involving the “asser-tion of a common world.”30    - when those who are presently “uncounted” within a polity aim to publicly articulate a wrong to be re-dressed, they attempt to make themselves “of some account” by enacting a radical equality the social order denies (a scenario that, to Rancière, is definitive of democracy as such).            \"dispositions, habits of mind, affective comportments, and felt commitments of its participants (and nonparticipants).\"          might be a good way to position how the \"worlds of care\"        Metrics of care              Attentiveness in passivity and activity is the way ella describes care. In the paper that I read talking about permeable heuristics of care(from ethicsofcare) the person spoke about precariousness and uncertainity. Paul seems to value accountability as way of understanding care. Shreyas seems to see continuity as the measure of care. Naveen brings the understanding of human fraility as well as ascribing value to human bodies.    Care: relations and scales and logics          \"\"That is, although caring for oneself, others, and the world have something in common—signaled by the presence of the term care—they are far from identical or even mutually supportive activities.\"\" Here she talks about care at three levels. yourselves, others and world. she contradicts herself in this \"\"The practitioner of such care is never a self but always an association of selves.

The end might be the same for some but the paths vary according to realities and each of these is a singular and collective distinct world path                            Clusters of Care            \"when those who are presently “uncounted” within a polity aim to publicly articulate a wrong to be re-dressed, they attempt to make themselves “of some account” by enacting a radical equality the social order denies (a scenario that, to Rancière, is definitive of democracy as such).\"      Read list  hannah arendt 'the human condition - amor mundi'          the telescope and human subjectivity    - Jacques Ranciere's theory of democracy"

      "url"      : "/notes/prj.Carpooling-Unalone-Karwaan",
      "content"  : "We explore how communities are formed, why carpooling hasn’t seen commercial success in India yet? In doing so, we design a community-based carpooling solution that uses events to bring these communities together.  Why hasn’t carpooling gained popularity in India?After some secondary research, we extracted some possible answers to this question. We looked at many things like:•\tWhat do Potential carpoolers want?•\tWho are the kinds of passengers that would potentially pool a ride?•\tWhat are the incentives for someone to pool a ride?•\tWhat are some reasons not to?•\tWhat were the challenges to Carpooling in the pre-technology era?•\tHow many of these were solved by Technology?•\tWhat remains to be solved?•\tSince most of these papers were from elsewhere, what were the defining factors in India?These are the clusters that we found:Aspirational value of a car: This related to the inherent value of a car as a status symbol in society. It is one of the things that people aspire to obtain.Safety: The inherent danger of getting into a stranger’s car is ever-present, especially in India.Inconvenience: Having to maintain pool discipline, the pool driver have to negotiate pick up points with every member individually. Also there were other factors here such as losing freedom of mobility because you are with others; your commute might be delayed because of your co-pooler; being packed in a carpool can test physical boundaries as well; having to take longer routes to pick up and drop the co-poolersLegal Ambiguity — The Indian Government has restricted private vehicles from undertaking commercial business. Inspite of this, there are many carpooling platforms running in India. However, this has kept prices on carpooling platforms relatively low, going as low as 3 INR per kilometer. Recently, the Karnataka government started fining people who were carpooling as wellLack of Awareness: This is a factor that we stumbled quite by accident while circulating a pilot questionnaire. People were aware of carpooling as an informal contract but not as a formalized platform based phenomenon.Social Barriers: These included the factors related to class differences, building a trust among poolmates, the additional responsibility of negotiating a system of timing and splitting costs, the possibility of coordination failure and the time needed to build a mutual understanding.We decided to observe the environments in which carpooling was working successfully in India. As a result, we soon found out that apps like Quick Ride, Ho Ho rides and Wunder were targeting the IT transport system in Bangalore, encouraging and creating favorable conditions for IT professionals to adopt carpooling while branding their actions as their contribution to a greater environmental good.Our interviews and interactions with people commuting as part of IT carpools showed us some factors that were boosting this trend:1.Cohort Travel: The ability to travel with people from the same background or same interests as you2.Part of corporate culture: Since these services were tied into the IT firms’ operations, adoption was easy for these professionals3.Platform tie-ups: Tie-ups of IT firms with carpooling platform adds to the previous factor and makes it easier to use4.Common destination: This is also a significant factor, as the destination is fixed, it removes a lot of the negotiation complexity of the carpool5.Shared context that is beyond carpooling itself: Since, they are from the same field, they share commonalities that extend beyond the fact that they are in a car together. This is great for a innate trust and better conversations, making the poolers less prone to anxiety and more likely to enjoy the banter.6.Regular Commute and Routine times: This factor along with the “Common Destination” factor reduced a lot of the complexity involved in this whole process.This led to a shift in our perspective — as we looked at ‘cohort/community travelling’ as an important component that dominated all the other ambiguous aspects of carpooling. Trust, shared community and culture had to become a part of any system that we designed.  “We are in for a longer game, we are here to build a culture and community of carpoolers than looking at profitability at the moment”,Vivek Kumar, a marketing manager at Wunder.The Principles we set down for the system we were designing  It had to be fun  It had to be community-basedAt the time, we as a team had come up with a prototype which I will link hereHowever, I came up with my own prototype using Figma, herePeople Involved: @BaishnabiMonger, @SamarthGupta, @SarojTailor, @AnantKaur, @MicahAlexMy contribution: #systemdesign, #QualitativeResearch, #marketresearch"

      "content"  : "While studying the Paniya community in Kerala, I was first introduced to the severity of caste issues in India. I have covered all my research about the tribe in this two-part series- part 1 https://medium.com/micah-alex/how-i-was-introduced-to-the-struggles-of-tribal-communities-in-kerala-caf2e8b94a9a talks about their current socio-economic and physical conditions and part 2 https://medium.com/micah-alex/how-to-destroy-an-entire-community-in-three-steps-27bb8bd5c960 delves deeper and tries to find ties between their past oppressive histories and their current conditions. With this project in particular, I have also written a complimentary piece that fills up a lot of the gaps in the linked Behance projecthttps://www.behance.net/gallery/76085663/Speculative-Storytelling. We wanted to let the children create their own stories using our tapestry tool. However, we also decided to make a sample tapestry just as a test prototype. Gopika and Veda- my teammates and dear friends- put their heads together to use a simple stitching method with any waste cloth to help the kids create these stories.We needed cultural context to make the stories relevant and reachable to the kids. We needed to use metaphors that came from within the community and not entirely from our heads. For this reason, we organized and analyzed, whatever we knew about the community under the Causal Layered Analysis. The CLA helps us identify the invisible threads that run under societies and services. This was where we derived the metaphors that we used in the story.Their traditional dance, 'Vattakalli' is inspired from the movement of elephants, so we wanted to keep the elephants central to the story. The elephants represent their belief in themselves. The rain and the floods were an obvious reference to the 2018 floods.This complimentary article reflects on how easy it was for me to simplify the problems that I was investigating and arrive at a solution that may never work. It also shows how complex systems need more than just linear/monocycle designs.People Involved: @GopikaVerma,  @JahnviVegad, @VedaSeshan, @MicahAlexMy contribution: Literature Review, story writing, story boarding, activity guide, Participatory Design, Speculative Design"
