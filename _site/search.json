      "content"  : "Thoughts before the CapstoneThe theories of care are many and diverse, I have started to look beyond the repository and the initial set of literature I had found. I started with the various frameworks of care and ethics in practice.  Through reading [[Worldly Ethics - The democratic ethics of care for worldly things]] and how Ellla Myers has defined the way she is talking about care, I started to do two things, I have started to form an understanding of how different people set apart their notions of care. Annemarie Mol for instance has approached it through the logics of practice. I need to read that in more detail, however, by bringing together a distinction that presupposes process in an established world she is different from Ella inasmuch as I have read. Ella sets it to be a worthy task to set up the world first. She defines the world of care in opposition to the self/other paradigm of care.  Hannah Arendt’s notion of amor mundi, or love of the world. It may be useful to look at the different ways love/something abstract like that has been theorised in more than the terms of self vs others.  She also centers the actions of care and divides the concepts etymologically by separating the caring about and caring for. Is it possible to do this for marathi and malayalam.  I am also starting a literature based inquiry into Indian ideas of care, through works of authors, I think this is a worthy pursuit because of the two stories I helped translate.  I need however, to prioritize the reading(literature) and writing(reflections) to be done before may 20. Its going to be a difficult task considering the length of some of these texts.  Ella myers for now must take priority.  Other than these, I might have to look at conversational interfaces and a way to understand the role of metatools in collaborative work.  I need to also understand how practice turns into research or knowledge produced.  Hysallo's [[The Mundane and Strategic Work in Collaborative Design]] is important again with Annemarie's understanding of care and how the routine work is important. I have to start looking at the clusters of care and how that fits with the worlds thingClusters of care### Oiling the Wheels - Archetypes        -   The maintainers do the work of keeping things alive. Annemarie talks about this as lot more than just routine(mundane work). It is the understanding that in the [[logic of care]], things shift and conversations must keep happening. The maintainers keep an attitude of tenacity and adaptibility(AM) and learn to keep trying because the action is the moral activity of care.        -   The maintainers that I have observed range from Shreyas to Vinay to Dilip to Supriya, from the understanding that the work must continue. As soon as the lockdown was announced, Shreyas got together with Geeta and Supriya in trying to build a website for DLL. It was a process of learning together on various platforms and trying things out.        -   Design Beku. in a conversation about how the a big designer's collective was running the design equivalent of a hackathon. Naveen said how the long work has to find a home in db after the hackathon. The initial momentum of many of these projects had failed.        -   This doesn't mean that the maintainers are strangers to failure. For a common lunch that was supposed to bring together various voices of Bidar to discuss the matter of responding to CAA-NRC, someone slipped through the invitations. I was told that it hurt because a woman writer had not been invited. Dilip told me later how it was a failure of planning and how it meant that she would drift apart a little. But he was confident in how they would win her trust back.        -   Maintainers must also understand the role of people-their bodies, their practices and their places to hold networks together. Liyaqat sir, is a renowned collector of historical artifacts. Shreyas tells me that this also however his lament. When they met him for the first time, he lamented the fact that his children wouldn't keep up his practice and that this practice of held so little value in the eyes of the public. Whereas he had such amazing items ranging from [[dunno]]. He told me about how these artifacts and their stories made L a keeper of public memory rather than just a collector of antiquities. They therefore used some of the funds to send him timely appreciation packages for his work.   ### Making as a practice        -   The slow and Polished        -   The quick and dirty        -   Meta-tooling  ###  Carefull-conversation        -   Representational design        -   Researching through learning        -   Conflicts as a practice of care   Archiving as a practice    -   UnforgettingThoughts about the Capstone - 1 year laterDoes it need to fit into a particular domain* Would domainifying this lead to its remediation* [[Commoning the Inbetweens- Compost Pitch#Reflections and Thoughts on the piece]] - remdiation in context 1* infrastructuring as meme - remediation in context 2\t ## Paul's thoughts -  \"The archetypes work well because they can be plugged into different communities. a maintainer in one field looks very differernt in another\"Archivethe first draft is hard to get out and I follow one of two approaches, gardening or planning or some hybrid. The writing process started off with a simple outline which I then followed with a graphic illustration of each of the section. This helped me sort out my metaphors and make a much more expanded outline. After talking to shreyas, I decided to strucure it the way that I would, without academic boundaries. Is there a translation possible between the two?Even then my outline is now based the questions, and that allows for a little bit of Non-Linear Storytelling[[Narratives- Map of Concepts]]"

      "content"  : "We explore how communities are formed, why carpooling hasn’t seen commercial success in India yet? In doing so, we design a community-based carpooling solution that uses events to bring these communities together.  Why hasn’t carpooling gained popularity in India?After some secondary research, we extracted some possible answers to this question. We looked at many things like:•\tWhat do Potential carpoolers want?•\tWho are the kinds of passengers that would potentially pool a ride?•\tWhat are the incentives for someone to pool a ride?•\tWhat are some reasons not to?•\tWhat were the challenges to Carpooling in the pre-technology era?•\tHow many of these were solved by Technology?•\tWhat remains to be solved?•\tSince most of these papers were from elsewhere, what were the defining factors in India?These are the clusters that we found:Aspirational value of a car: This related to the inherent value of a car as a status symbol in society. It is one of the things that people aspire to obtain.Safety: The inherent danger of getting into a stranger’s car is ever-present, especially in India.Inconvenience: Having to maintain pool discipline, the pool driver have to negotiate pick up points with every member individually. Also there were other factors here such as losing freedom of mobility because you are with others; your commute might be delayed because of your co-pooler; being packed in a carpool can test physical boundaries as well; having to take longer routes to pick up and drop the co-poolersLegal Ambiguity — The Indian Government has restricted private vehicles from undertaking commercial business. Inspite of this, there are many carpooling platforms running in India. However, this has kept prices on carpooling platforms relatively low, going as low as 3 INR per kilometer. Recently, the Karnataka government started fining people who were carpooling as wellLack of Awareness: This is a factor that we stumbled quite by accident while circulating a pilot questionnaire. People were aware of carpooling as an informal contract but not as a formalized platform based phenomenon.Social Barriers: These included the factors related to class differences, building a trust among poolmates, the additional responsibility of negotiating a system of timing and splitting costs, the possibility of coordination failure and the time needed to build a mutual understanding.We decided to observe the environments in which carpooling was working successfully in India. As a result, we soon found out that apps like Quick Ride, Ho Ho rides and Wunder were targeting the IT transport system in Bangalore, encouraging and creating favorable conditions for IT professionals to adopt carpooling while branding their actions as their contribution to a greater environmental good.Our interviews and interactions with people commuting as part of IT carpools showed us some factors that were boosting this trend:  Cohort Travel: The ability to travel with people from the same background or same interests as you  Part of corporate culture: Since these services were tied into the IT firms’ operations, adoption was easy for these professionals  Platform tie-ups: Tie-ups of IT firms with carpooling platform adds to the previous factor and makes it easier to use  Common destination: This is also a significant factor, as the destination is fixed, it removes a lot of the negotiation complexity of the carpool  Shared context that is beyond carpooling itself: Since, they are from the same field, they share commonalities that extend beyond the fact that they are in a car together. This is great for a innate trust and better conversations, making the poolers less prone to anxiety and more likely to enjoy the banter.  Regular Commute and Routine times: This factor along with the “Common Destination” factor reduced a lot of the complexity involved in this whole process.This led to a shift in our perspective — as we looked at ‘cohort/community travelling’ as an important component that dominated all the other ambiguous aspects of carpooling. Trust, shared community and culture had to become a part of any system that we designed.  “We are in for a longer game, we are here to build a culture and community of carpoolers than looking at profitability at the moment”,Vivek Kumar, a marketing manager at Wunder.The Principles we set down for the system we were designing  It had to be fun  It had to be community-basedAt the time, we as a team had come up with a prototype which I will link hereHowever, I came up with my own prototype using Figma, herePeople Involved: @BaishnabiMonger, @SamarthGupta, @SarojTailor, @AnantKaur, @MicahAlexMy contribution: System Design, Qualitative Research, Market Research"

Our experiences with implementing a community-owned mesh network in Bidar brought up questions that really don't fit into the neo-liberal imaginations of internetworking. In projects like these, spaces have to be made for the people, the place and their histories with each other. But Digital Commoning might also bring out new imaginations of how technology can be used to support over solve, a relegation to a smaller role. The narratives of tech-saviorism are still very prevalent in the movement. These will still lead us down the path of creating privileged, reductionist spaces that will still be non-inclusive.What are the alternate imaginations of the Phygital spaces, the Caring Communes, the Fertile Forests that emerge from the cracks?Version 2Understanding the optimism of the digital commons also means to be aware of its limitations and pitfalls. What it then offers us is the opportunity to shift away from tech-saviourism and understand it for it is - a limited tool that still hasn’t developed to be complex enough to respond to deep cultural histories or inclusive enough to accept the narratives of specific people, places and events or flexible enough to adapt to different imaginations of “internetworking” or the patience to deal with non-capitalistic timeframes, the everyday mundaneness and all the associated inbetweens. But what this understanding also offers us is the knowledge of the in-betweens that technology cannot “solve/cover”. We then come to the conclusion that technology must work to support over solve.We recently were part of a project to establish a local mesh network to act as an intranet of local archives that would collectively function as a knowledge network.

      "url"      : "/notes/Condom-Ads-A-Commentary",
      "content"  : "Condom Ads: A Commentary  Disclaimer: Might have wild claims, please ignore. Storing it for the archive.IntroductionPublic sector condoms appeared on the market in the late 1960s when Hindustan Latex Corporation in Kerala was established to manufacture the Nirodh condom. At this time, condoms were privately manufactured and sold at high prices, it was accessible at a cost of 25 paise by a few wealthier populations while population growth rate was highest among the lower income groups.The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) team suggested to the government to import condoms and sell them at 5 paise per condom which was affordable to the average Indian. Through funding from USAID, SIDA, and the Ford Foundation, the Indian government then imported 400 million condoms in 1968.The Indian government started distributing condoms free of cost through family planning clinics and community workers, and at subsidized prices through community-based distributors and post offices under the depot holder scheme.NirodhIn order to further improve access to condoms, the Government launched the Nirodh Marketing Program in 1968; through the Nirodh Marketing Program in March 1972, it was estimated that monthly average use of condoms was up to 7 million pieces.\"To increase the acceptability of condom – for both men and women – there is a need to create a positive image for their use. It will definitely prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases,\" Kumar noted.Experts cite social stigma and a lack of privacy at condom-selling stores as reasons for a decline in the contraceptive use. Also, in rural areas, sexual health and issues related to intercourse are not discussed openly and pre-marital sex is frowned upon by elders despite young people engaging in it frequently.Another likely explanation for the abjectly poor use of condoms in India is social awkwardness. Thanks to the stigma around sex in India, buying condoms in India can in itself be an embarrassing task. While the stigma may be easier to deal with in metropolitan cities, in towns and villages, the situation is starkly different. Till now, the most significant barriers for this campaign are- lack of privacy in stores and social stigma associated with condom use.The government recently launched an online service to distribute condoms. The initiative has elicited a good response, with nearly one million condoms ordered so far. Experts say the high number of people ordering condoms online is proof that most Indians feel embarrassed to buy contraceptives from a store. Similarly, a 2005 study called “Linkages between masculinity and HIV/AIDS in North India”, conducted by students of the University of North Carolina, found that “masculine ideals of sexual conquest, experimentation, and entitlement” are major contributing factors to risky sexual behaviour in India. The study noted that of 75 respondents, some men intentionally ignored information about STIs in order to maintain a sense of normalcy.Other important aspects that discourage condom use — and work in tandem with social stigma — are personal reluctance, prevailing moral norms and taboos.Analysis of an AdColours used**The ad has red and yellow, demonstrating warm hues. Red and yellow have an uncommon place in Indian culture. Red is dynamic and continually breathing flame according to the spectator. It instigates fear and is the shading related with a standout amongst the most loved goddesses in Hindu folklore – Durga. Her red hot picture is improved by her red tongue and relatively red eyes. Red likewise remains for virtue and is the favored shading for a lady's article of clothing. Red has a profound importance in the Indian mind. It celebrates the joining between two individuals and is unmistakably originating from from the wedding, where the lady of the hour is decked in splendid tones of red to the red tikka that she decorates after the wedding as an indication of her responsibility. It is maybe simple to perceive any reason why red likewise symbolizes ripeness and thriving. It is the shade of the ripe dirt that procures gathers and better lives and is utilized broadly in petition functions and contributions. What's more, India could scarcely be commended as the place that is known for flavors without its most feisty fixing — chilies. And keeping in mind that red symbolizes fruitfulness and virtue, it additionally indicates a specific erotic nature and requests positive vitality. Turmeric, while being utilized for cooking in both the north and the south, is likewise utilized in services offering petitions and relational unions. Yellow symbolizes holiness and is a basic home grown fixing connected on the body and face by ladies in the subcontinent. In a nation saturated with religious convictions, the cause of most colours lies in the forces and legendary existences of its divine beings.Depiction of coupleThe couple is standing on a beach at a time that is close to sunset. . The clothes they are wearing are baggy(taboo of the body) but easy to maneuver out of. The beach invokes humidity and warmth as an image. The same feelings are associated with sex, bleeding into adjectives like steamy sex and hot sex. The need to suggest the context in as many ways as possible is very apparent. Pleasure was the taboo here. But it still represents the pleasure in a sexual act but through a suggestion of a couple. This tendency was then taken forward in time where pleasure became the main selling point in many adverts. The conservativeness was the result of governmental influence.Fonts usedThe ads of the time used bold text or straight. The italics were used to depict either something off the beaten path or to suggest some mischievous contexts. The word ‘Nirodh’ meaning stop is in bold relaying a certain strength and reliability. The focus is the diseases here, which has since been dropped because of its general unpleasantness. There is an attempt to blend the text of the features into the background, revealing the hesitation behind making pleasure the focus of the product rather than the function parts of the product.Social TaboosThe condom manufacturers have tried to change the stigma around condoms in many ways in the past. In the 1930s this advt that ran on print media about condoms was largely scientific and not very pleasure-centric. the technical parts of the product are highlighted, the visuals are nominal and are reminiscent of product drawings, the language is scientificIn late 1980s several TV commercial were developed to create awareness about ‘Nirodh’, however, the message from these advertisements was not clear like what is condom, who use it, where to get it or distributed free of cost.The 90sIn 1991 the KamaSutra brand condom was introduced and the brand advertised their product with erotic images of Bollywood actors, linking condoms to pleasure for the first time. Also, Zaroor condoms used funny taglines to catch eyeballsUsing the taboo around sex by talking about it in the same naughty conspirational way that is typical of that time while also poking fun at that attitude toward sex. Making fun in rhymes became a benign path of addressing the issue and eliminated the possibility of a backlash. Also the motivation to not become a father is important, using the kind of language that a male engaging in pre-marital or extra-marital sex might speak. This shows the shifting of the user from couplesIn March 2008, BBC World Service Trust launched a campaign about condoms to being a “real man”. Further, they launched the ‘Condom Ringtone’ aimed to engage people on a taboo topic.This went on in many ways, in some places targeting the awkwardness of asking for a condom in the first place. Understanding the journey of having sex, the brands have identified the stress point of asking for condoms to pharmaceutical storesBy providing readymade abbreviations that both the customer and the pharmacist can use as a code, it removed one more barrier.Other Campaigns dealing with stigma- [[Balbir Pasha: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/brand-equity/whos-this-balbir-pasha/articleshow/34297026.cms?from=mdr]]"

However, we also decided to make a sample tapestry just as a test prototype. Gopika and Veda used a simple stitching method with any waste cloth to help the kids create these stories.We needed cultural context to make the stories relevant and reachable to the kids. We needed to use metaphors that came from within the community and not entirely from our heads. For this reason, we organized and analyzed, whatever we knew about the community under the Causal Layered Analysis. The CLA helps us identify the invisible threads that run under societies and services. This was where we derived the metaphors that we used in the story.Their traditional dance, 'Vattakalli' is inspired from the movement of elephants, so we wanted to keep the elephants central to the story. The elephants represent their belief in themselves. The rain and the floods were an obvious reference to the 2018 floods.

It may not be possible to read all of them at a go so I recommend reading through the article and then choosing the links you want to read.  A Literature Review  These were some readings and anecdotes that set the foundation of my knowledge about that tribe. This is an annotated list of these readings and the things I learnt from them  Population      The scheduled tribes’ population in Kerala is (4.85 lacs)1.45% of the general population according to the 2011 census.      Caste Names, Structures in Wayanad        In this reading, I read how the caste system was organized in Wayanad. Pages 1–13 outline each of the tribes, their histories and how they got their names, which is interesting because of the implications it has for the phrase “What’s in a name”; pages 14–19 describe the history of Wayanad and its Adivasi populations and page 20 describes the tribe at the focus of this article- The Paniyans.      Periods of Paniya history        Kulirani summarizes Paniya history consisting of 4 periods: an early hunter-gatherer period leading to a long period of being agrarian slaves. Then as liberated wage earners, they entered an extremely competitive market, grew dependent on state welfare as a rising sense of desperation and hopelessness set in      The tribal people are not a monolith        This paper outlines the facts and figures that inconveniently show the inter-tribal disparity in benefits gained from welfare schemes and how the backward tribes were left behind. Schemes like the NREGS were being used as employment and income-generation majorly by the relatively forward tribes. There are huge differences in the socio-economic and political lives of different tribes.    This inter-tribal disparity is demonstrated even more strongly in this paper. It shows why it is a mistake to consider the tribes as a monolithic group of people, because of the vast differences even in those groups. It also shows the stark contrast between the ST communities and the other non-tribal groups      Work and Employment for Adivasis        They are without political representation, economic growth or physical wellbeing. This paper shows the kind of work that the Adivasis do and their average monthly earnings(2016).      The alienation through the education system        While researching how a school can be set up for tribal children, we were alerted by a teacher to the various problems that hinder Paniya children’s education- restlessness in the class, truancy(often encouraged by their parents), living far away from the school, alcoholism being a community addiction etc. In my research, I found that a lot of these were explained by this paper (This is a very interesting read that helps you question the inclusivity of our educational models)This is an interesting video on how an Education system with the Adivasis in mind would lookhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKtKeOGWQQ&amp;feature=emb_title  Public Perceptions  Our discussions with the locals brought up the themes of the Paniyans being lazy, unreliable, alcoholic and living off the government’s welfare schemes. This, I found later, goes to show how oppressive systems perpetuate destruction  We also saw, firsthand, how the Paniyas had become a spectacle when our guide stopped the rickshaw because he some of them walking by and told us to take photos. We learnt later that this might be because of the amount of social research and government aid that is centered around them    Plantation Economy    A majority of the Paniya workers worked with paddy-cultivation and were losing work because of the expansion of the plantations and because they weren’t as easily absorbed into the plantation labor economy [1][2]    Out of the Financial System    The majority of Paniya population was excluded from the financial sector and abstained from any formal financial activity    Health and Caste    The Paniya Tribe is beset by health problems on every side. [1] explains the gravity of the problem of malnutrition in Paniya children. It also shows how the Paniyas have underutilized the governmental schemes available and how that signifies a terrible deprivation at community levels. [2] outlines the effects of caste on the health of tribal women — how lower castes find caste magnifying their vulnerabilities while upper castes are protected by an invisible caste buffer. [3] outlines the occurrence of various diseases among the Adivasis and also has statistics on morbidity patterns of the Paniyas. To add to this, Sickle Cell Anaemia, which is already prevalent in tribal communities, was even more present in the Paniya Communities.[[           They also suffer from sickle cell anaemia in large numbers. Nearly fifteen percent of the population suffers from sickle cell anaemia. This disease is quite difficult and painful to cure because it needs a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. It's usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant.::rmn]][[There are Government Hospitals, Community Health Centers, Primary health centres, Sub-centres which have good coverage. But since the tribals live in such remote areas, the health centres were not enough. To solve this, the government has instituted mobile medical units to cater to the remote parcels of land that the tribals live in. There is one ASHA worker for every 1000 people. Often they are the first-responders and alert the government healthcare infrastructure to any problems faced by the tribal peoples. Historically, the Paniyas have refused to have any involvement with the healthcare infrastructure of the government. An interview with a healthcare worker at a Mananthawady subcentre near northern Wayanad revealed that the aversion ran so deep that they refused to even accompany someone who was ill to the hospital. This maybe, as she puts it, the fear of healthcare institutions or the fear of being manipulated which is embedded in their origin story. The origin story alerts them to the dangers of getting too familiar with more dominant powers and the suffering that follows after. Other than the ASHA workers, there is a subcentre with limited facilities but primary healthcare for every 5000 people. There are 198 such subcentres in Wayanad. The next two levels are Community Health Centres and Government Hospitals. The Government Hospital in Wayanad is in Kalpetta. Often this is the only place that can handle specialized operations like deliveries. This is one more thing that is restricting access to quality healthcare for the tribals who normally live in far flung areas.::lsn]]System Map of Issues  Decreasing Health, Alienation, Landlessness, Erosion of Cultural Pride, Anger, Lack of Wealth and a disconnected populationAfter seeing the connections between Erosion of Cultural Pride and Anger, Landlessnessness and Wealthlessness and Alienation and Disconnection.  Every single child labourer that I have documented comes from a highly impoverished family unit and belongs to a low-caste or minority community.Siddharth Kara  Understanding the History  Through the readings mentioned above as well as few current media pieces as well as stories and songs that the Paniya peoples tell about themselves.I then mapped this into the three stages of alienation (in the footsteps of  Kulirani[[The Disenfranchisement of Adivasis in Kerala#Periods of Paniya history]] whose work I had mentioned in the earlier article)A Rich Culture mixed with Centuries of OppressionCultural Artifacts and PracticesStories and Songs:Through most of their rituals and practices, the scars of slavery can be seen clearly. They call themselves the 'Ippi-mala makkal' -meaning The children of the mountain called Ippi. However, the name they are called, ‘Paniyan’ means worker. This story of oppression is also clearly evident in the story they tell of their origins:  On a hill called Ippi-mala (Mt. Ippi), there was a temple with a Brahmin priest and Jain Gounder. The priest would often observe a boy and a girl playing near the temple well. So they captured the children with help of another tribal man who worked for them. The children then worked for them, after which the gounder got them married to each other and they had five daughters and five sons. The Paniya regard them to be their first ancestors.There are other variations of this story that warn the Paniya against manipulation from the upper castes. In that version, the Paniyas are enslaved because one of them was lured using good food that he then told the others about.Rachel Santosh writes about the ceremony where the Paniya were sold to different landlords at the Valliyoorkaavu temple every year. The ritual that confirmed the transaction consisted of songs that showed how much the Paniyans suffered under their slavers. In the songs that are sung, god (padachavan) approves of their bondage and wills it so. Ironically, this temple is the biggest place of Paniyan worship now — they get special privileges at the temple as well.Other stories talk of the Paniyan afterlife — which does not constitute heaven or hell.  After death, the soul splits into two- the soul shadow (nizhelu) and the ancestral spirit (pene). God takes the nizhelu of a paniyan and puts it in the body of another paniyan that is born after him. The pene goes down to the keenadu(netherworld) where the pene will have the same occupation and work under the same master. The bondages in the present world continue in the netherworld also. This means that there is no freedom for the Paniyan even after death.Dance and Music:They also have a dance called the “Vattakalli” which is inspired by the movement of elephants. It is accompanied by instruments like the thudi.History of the Paniyans:  A tribal girl once asked me modestly, ”When we go to school, we read about Mahatma Gandhi. Did we have no heroes like that? Did we always suffer like this?”Mahasweta Devi, Imaginary Maps 1993OriginsNo one really knows about the origins of the Paniyas. Some theories state that they are the original inhabitants of India. They, themselves say that they were brought to the Wayanad region by a Malabar King but have no records of when or who that king was.They initially lived as hunter-gatherers in the forests, sometimes straying into the farms of the landlords of the time to steal some food and then run away. Soon the landlords got tired of this behavior and enslaved them and made them work in the fields as bonded laborers. This incident is preserved in the origin story that the Paniyans tell about themselves about their origins. However, the veracity might be dubious considering all the other stories which seem to be told by or board towards the upper castes.As slaves that are sold with the land, they worked under the upper caste Namboothiris and Nairs or the ‘janmis’ (rightful inheritors of the land). This caste hierarchy has had great effects on the cultural stories of the Paniyans- they called themselves the ‘kachavanmar’( lowest of the low). Other castes and subcastes were also cultivators but they were the tenants of the ‘janmis’. The Paniya and the Adiya were the bonded laborers who did the work on the land. The Paniyas were also known to be ‘fearless’ and were used as weapons in vendettas between the janmis, often robbing or killing the enemies of their masters.Settler OppressionThere were many political upheavals during this time from Tipu Sultan to Pazhassi Raja to the invasion of the British, but the situation of the Paniyans remained them same. Working from dawn to dusk for meager amounts of money, they were treated as objects and property. This only changed in the early 20th century, after the British tried to put a stop to the slave trade. Soon after, a new wave of migrants came to Wayanad and the Paniyans moved on to daily wage work. There was a little more freedom now, but the means of exploitation only changed into other subtle but equally nefarious forms.These new Christian and Muslim immigrant landlords forced Paniyans out of the little land they were given under the Janmis. Since the Paniyas rarely had any paperwork regarding their ownership, they had to move. Some of these landlords would put fire to their colonies so that they would clear another patch of forest for the landlord to convert into farmland- at no expense. They even paid the Paniyans partly in alcohol and encouraged an addiction to it so that they would continue to work under them. They also exploited their illiteracy and would often trick them into signing off huge parcels of their land without them knowing or understanding what they were signing off. Other landlords took sizeable populations of the Paniyas and Adiyas with them to their homelands in different districts and settled them there.Wealthlessness due to Landlessness  The lack of access to their own land, combined with this expectation to perform free labour and the threat of violence and economic boycott against those who challenge their expected social roles, keeps many Dalit families in bondage and a perpetual state of poverty  India Exclusion Report, 2014Despite the abundance of land reform attempts, Landlessness is a very serious issue as Paniya households own the least land on average among the other tribes in Wayanad. When coupled with their forced exile from forest lands this has led to the shrinkage of livelihood options for the Paniya. This has profound implications as they weren’t able to move into other professions, create wealth -or in extension political power- which became the biggest roadblock to land reforms in modern Kerala. The landowners have too much political clout that they frequently use to thwart movements by the landless marginalized.Land Reforms in KeralaAfter the state of Kerala was formed, an act that made it illegal to own land above 15 acres was passed. However, plantations were exempted from this act. In this process, many landowners got away by declaring their land as a plantation. There is evidence to show that because these huge plantations were exempted from this act, the Paniyas were forced into small overcrowded ghettos.The Forest Rights Act that aimed to empower the tribes that live off the forest ended up excluding the Paniya community from the list of tribes that can use and sell forest produce. With this, they were cut off from their past as well because prior to their enslavement they were hunter-gatherers in the forests. Not only were they alienated from those forests but now they were also banned from using those skills in wealth creation.Other than that, there have been several attempts to reform land practices. This was and is, however, repeatedly being sabotaged by unwilling governments, powerful landowners and cunning businessmen. Even after two successive acts in 1975 and 1999 and an HC order demanding the restoration of land to the tribals, the distribution of land has been meager and often inhabitable.Aralam and other Land Crimes - Land AssertionThe story of how Aralam (a heartbreaking read of the violence that they had to face even when things looked calm on the outside), a centralized farm was distributed to tribals but without any kind of support in the way forward. They lived in semi-starvation conditions without power or knowledge of how to tend for the crops that were already there on the farms that they were given. It also talks about the malicious tactics that the government employed to evict those whose claims they saw as invalid is a case in point.There have been land struggles for the Adivasis at almost every piece of land that was to be restored to them. This article lists out a small history of such struggles. This systemic apathy has given rise to many political tribal movements that have demanded the restoration of land in movements called “land assertion”. As a community, they would occupy the land and protest the inaction of the government. These movements, however, received a huge setback in Kerala during what the media called the “Muthanga Incident”. The official report of how the police fired on an angry Adivasi crowd is contrasted by the Rajmanikyam probe commissioned by People’s Judicial Enquiry Commission shows how the community was targeted by keeping their children and tribal women hostage and torturing them. Other activists, such as C.K. Janu- the leader of the AGMS — Adivasi Gothra Mahasabha were imprisoned.These movements were also harmed by powerful parties using divisive tactics to split the movement on the basis of leaders, districts and affiliations. A unified movement to demand land soon broke down.The systematic land grab over the years has been affecting tribal populations significantly and adversely. This is why these movements have come to believe that ownership of land is the only way out for these communities to grow. Which seems to be verified by this paper, that highlights the differences in land claims for the Dalits and the Adivasis. It theorizes that the reason only 22% of Dalits vs 49% of the tribals are still engaged in agriculture is the difference in land allotment. Since, a lot of the Dalits received land as part of the land reforms, they were able to gain social mobility and move into other sectors of work that will remain closed for the landless tribes.Consequences on Health and Financial ConditionsAs of now, a majority of the Paniyas face malnutrition on a large scale. The uprooting of that community from forestlands where they were able to find nutritional food plays a huge role in this. Not having land, means that the Paniyas must work as agricultural laborers in other landowners’ fields. This, when coupled with their tendency to not save any money owing to the hopelessness for a good future that is often seen in many oppressed indigenous peoples. This is a great article shows how trauma in the Native American peoples has mirrored the trauma in the Paniyas as well. Alcoholism is rampant in such communities and further contributes to the loss of wealth.In this vicious circle, they then approach the owners of the land they work in for money. Adding debt to this dangerous circle makes it almost impossible to escape. Even though ‘bonded labour’ is apparently outlawed, these forms of slavery and feudalism still remain.  “The sign of ultimate oppression working is when the oppressor can take away his hands, stand back and say ‘look at what they’re doing to themselves.’”  — Jessica GourneauLack of Access and Lack of TrustNo Access:CK Janu on the political position of AdivasisFor this section, I’d like to quote C.K. Janu, leader of the AGMS (an Adivasi activist who has been at the forefront of many politically organised movements for Adivasi upliftment. Read more about this inspirational leader here)  Traditionally, Adivasis maintained a harmonious relationship with their land, both cultivated and forest land, and it formed an integral part of their lives. Also, these resources are inseparable to the Adivasi way of living. By and large, Adivasis were uneducated people and they earned their living by making use of the resources available to them — their lands. So they have a symbiotic relationship with the soil and even now they haven’t turned away from this eco-centric culture.  Now, after the setting up of Adivasi colonies, they are in a crisis. Land is the primal symbol of power. So without tackling the issues regarding the ownership of land, Adivasis’ problems cannot be resolved. Only those who have land can play an active role in the socio-political and cultural spheres of the society. So those who are pushed to the margins are effectively alienated from the modern institutions of power with respect to politics, bureaucracy, and social order.  For Adivasis, the resources that they get from the land are their sole revenue and therefore they maintain a blood-relation with their land. So they cannot survive without their lands.  During the Land Reforms in the 1960s, the Kerala state government decided the upper limit of land that can be possessed by an individual as 15 acres. But this limit was not applicable to the estate plantations that cultivated cash crops. Through this law, the Government assumed the ownership of the excess land. This in effect, led to the ghettoization of the Adivasi communities as they were pushed to the reserves and colonies.Ghettoization of these communitiesThe Tenancy Reforms Act of 1970 contributed to the process of creating Dalit and Adivasi colonies and recent studies show that there is a total of 12,500 Dalit and 4,082 Adivasi colonies in the state.[1]This ghettoization meant that the Adivasis now live in small parcels of land that are often remote and inaccessible. They often face scarcities because of this. Water supply to these overcrowding of colonies is often intermittent and unclean. The overcrowding and the locations in remote places also make them really hard to reach. This has special significance in the matter of accessibility to services. In Wayanad, some colony members have to travel 30 kilometers to the nearest government hospital for a childbirth. Even though, medical services are free in the government PHCs, THCs and Government Hospitals the travel to and from there costs upto 500 Rs in some cases which is often a lot as they earn up to 400 Rs a day for working in the fields.2018 FloodsThis inaccessibility was clearly also revealed in the recent floods, where rescue workers couldn't go to the colonies because of how remote and unknown they were. There were also clear cases of discrimination rising up out of the disaster.No trust:The dystopia of the Kerala ModelFrom all of these, we finally arrive at a conjunction of all these issues playing out and against each other. A lack of trust in everyone but themselves, and for good reason. The government, no matter which party, which has often touted its credentials under the hyped label of the ‘Kerala Model’ has repeatedly been unable to eke out the political will to actually do something radically bold and helpful for the landless marginalized. This kind of ostracization meant that violence against these communities is often hidden away or ignored. These kinds of oppressed communities have huge numbers of unwed mothers that were either manipulated or abused. It is no different for the Paniyas.M.S. Sreerekha on Land Alienation and Restorative JusticeTo end this I’d like to quote from M.S. Sreerekha’s report:  Both the state and civil society wish to interpret and believe that alienation as such has never happened. Many, who were for or against restoration of land, today prefer to believe it is actually impractical. Alienation is a thing of the past and it is too much of a responsibility on the Adivasi community today to prove it though in reality one wonders whether there is any land ever that has not been alienated from the Adivasis.  Alienation in itself is a sensitive matter and so is the need for restoration of land. Should land be “restored”? If yes, is that “impractical” due to the state’s inability to face the “organised resistance” against it?  In the decades of never-ending legal battles, the adivasi community has experienced and learned the complexities that law can create. They have seen that a change of words or definitions on one piece of legislation on land, restored, alienated, forest, non- forest, immovable property, agricultural, non-agricultural, revenue land, forest land…and the ways in these can be used/misused means a lot to them.…. the only changing “ground reality” is that the long fight against the migrant, upper caste/class settlers within the state has today become a struggle against the state and many big plantation owners and private agriculturalists, working hand in hand."

      "content"  : "The Impostor Among Us🔮 \"How do platforms compel/enable the manufacturing of \"truth\" and \"ignorance\"? And what does that mean in the context of live-streaming politicians\"  These are notes from a Design Baithak hosted by Micah and PaulTL;DRThere are two parts we are juxtaposing. Firstly the idea of politicians on Twitch (a live-streaming platform) put into the context of Twitch's various affordances and subcultures. The second part takes the idea of manufactured \"authenticity\" and manufactured \"ignorance\" that are enabled/compelled by platform cultures and interfaces.  Understanding virtual worlds is important because “we increasingly live in a world in which opting out of technological systems is more and more difficult and yet participation within those systems pushes us to accept structures we might oppose” (Taylor 2006a:135).  - Tom Boellstorff (Coming of Age in Second life: An Anthropologist explores the Virtually Human)Question: What does the idea of live-streaming platforms mean for politics, information and networks as we know it?AOC and Ilhan Omar stream on Twitch; What is the Twitch Culture Like:On 21st October, AOC and Ilhan Omar, two congresswomen from the USA went on Twitch, a live-streaming platform, and played a bunch of games with Twitch streamers. It was one of the most watched streams with over 4 Lac concurrent viewers and totally near 1 crore views over the course of the stream. This is an extensive account of the events that transpired. It includes accounts of how it was set-up, who was involved, how moderation for the usually rowdy Twitch chat was planned- while keeping the constitutional regulations set on the Congresswomen.

Twitch is quite unlike other live-streaming platforms in the way that is its own microcosm.  The story of Prometheus describes one mythic moment when humans, receiving the gift of techne, became fully human for the first time. Since humans are always crafting themselves through culture, they have always been virtual (Clark 2003). The virtual is the anthropological. This makes it possible to study virtual worlds with the same flexible, underdetermined ethnographic tools used to study human cultures in the actual world. - Tom Boellstorff (Coming of Age in Second life: An Anthropologist explores the Virtually Human)  Reading List Item 2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFZWWJADtysPewdiepie reacting to Streamers getting trolled, streamsniped, donowalled etc.Twitch sub-cultures have their own unique languages, behaviours, histories, skeletons and demographics.

Reading List Item 6Agnotology and Epistemological Fragmentationa talk that invites us to re-examine, what it means to curate life as we live within and through the interface that has algorithmic mediation, being subverted towards strange tangents.Quotes from the Article  Whether we’re talking about the erasure of history or the undoing of scientific knowledge, agnotology is a tool of oppression by the powerful.  Epistemology is the term that describes how we know what we know. Most people who think about knowledge think about the processes of obtaining it. Ignorance is often assumed to be not-yet-knowledgeable. But what if ignorance is strategically manufactured? What if the tools of knowledge production are perverted to enable ignorance? In 1995, Robert Proctor and Iain Boal coined the term “agnotology” to describe the strategic and purposeful production of ignorance.  One of the best ways to seed agnotology is to make sure that doubtful and conspiratorial content is easier to reach than scientific material.  One tactic is to exploit “data voids.” These are areas within a search ecosystem where there’s no relevant data; those who want to manipulate media purposefully exploit these.  YouTube has great scientific videos about the value of vaccination, but countless anti-vaxxers have systematically trained YouTube to make sure that people who watch the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s videos also watch videos asking questions about vaccinations or videos of parents who are talking emotionally about what they believe to be the result of vaccination. They comment on both of these videos, they watch them together, they link them together. This is the structural manipulation of media. Journalists often get caught up in telling “both sides,” but the creation of sides is a political project.  The creation of sides is a political project.  You will not achieve an informed public simply by making sure that high quality content is publicly available and presuming that credibility is enough while you wait for people to come find it. You have to understand the networked nature of the information war we’re in, actively be there when people are looking, and blanket the information ecosystem with the information people need to make informed decisions.  Reading List Item 7https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7FWr2Nvf9IHow Aesthetics (read platform affordances and cultures) change the way \"truth\" is told  Reading List Item 8The strange, sometimes sinister conspiracy theories on Sushant Singh Rajput's death that flourished on social mediaHow that affected India recently in the SSR caseQuotes from the Article    - The other prominent conspiracy theory features how FAU-G, the game developed by GOQII founder Vishal Gondal and promoted by Akshay Kumar were originally Rajput’s ideas. This theory is based on an Instagram post by the late actor where he was supposedly learning the basics of gaming from Khan Academy, during the lockdown. The claim was fact-checked by BOOMLive, and discredited, with clarifications from Gondal and his company nCORE Games.\t- Additionally, these groups present the trappings of the proverbial “rabbit hole”. Join one group, and Facebook’s algorithm offers you a carousel in the ‘Discover tab’ or “Suggested Groups” of at least eight to nine such groups or pages, which harbour similar interests. And typically, users get sucked in, keen to consume more content on similar matters.\t- The story about conspiracy theories on Sushant Singh Rajput’s death – bear a striking resemblance to QAnon conspiracy movement — which began in the United States and is now going global — to a large extent, underscores the global concerns about the information ecosystem, as it stands today. The several grievance-filled hashtags, deliberate misinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories arising out of large social media platforms are being mainstreamed by popular news channels, only for further content on those channels going back to the system, amplified by the same actors and drawing higher engagement.\t- “There’s the obvious link to the Bihar elections, and it gives them a good opportunity to create a parallel narrative, besides targeting the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra government, something that has been a constant since Thackeray became CM,” says the digital political strategist quoted earlier in the story. A recent report by social media researcher Joyojeet Pal and his team highlighted that the data showed “the important role played by politicians, especially the BJP, in proposing a ‘murder’ alternative to the ‘suicide’ narrative.”"

      "content"  : "(disclaimer: From 2018. Lots of unsubstantiated claims and I don't agree with quite a few of these anymore and many of these points I can articulate much better now)ScopeThe time for late capitalism and imperialist ideas of innovation are over. I propose that the definition of innovation be changed to include “inclusivity” as a primary criteria. Inclusivity is important in the Indian context because of the diverse labor-intensive market that is somewhat unique to India. While pre-independence we focused on majority population, we have forgotten that all the 1%, 2% communities represent a huge number when combined. They can become the driving forces of a new growth push for India. This is locked potential that could position India to be the frontrunners of innovation. But due to many different priorities, agendas and other constraints, we have not been able or willing, as a nation, to do anything about this. Government policies that encourage the entrepreneurial spirit are met with the general lack of skill among the youth. This is a grave problem for a country which has nearly half its population under 25. This has been compounded by the lack of power connections to many villages and the concentration of telephone infrastructure within the urban populace. This has set up a system where even the sporadic seeds of innovation that have cropped up in many sectors, find it very difficult to scale.Inclusive design: Boon and BaneInclusive innovation needs to include the excluded. This has historically rarely been the case, with dominant path innovation setting gateways for the marginalized to get on board. Alibaba started its delivery to rural areas using an ad-hoc post office mechanism that uniquely worked for the rural areas. This might, however, not be the most efficient approach because of its top down centralized design but it is important to  raising the standards of living for the marginalized. This rise in per capita income would definitely be accompanied with rising trend in consumption.What is the slippery slope hereReverse innovation necessitates the need for flexible education, democratic access to information and a privately-monitored funding for grassroots innovation. If we want to scale up as many frugal innovations as possible, the easiest path is to go through the already established resources of the private sector. While ideologically, it serves a problem because of the ways capitalism has time and again shown its imperialist fangs; practically, it makes most sense to appeal to their capitalist tendencies more than their altruism to get things done. This has always been THE slippery slope to climb when working within a flawed system. Another interesting insight that I found was the stats related to the Indian diaspora. They account for only 2% of the population but they earn the equivalent of nearly 66% of Indian GDP. Other than the corporate pathway to secure early-stage funding, this would be an interesting aspect to look at to sponsor the grassroots level growth of innovation.Refusing to adoptEven while technology looks like the only way forward in this direction, it has historically always excluded either people or traditions or historical contexts. This doesn’t have to be the case, we have an opportunity to instill in the rural populace the Amish mindset toward technology while also making it readily available to them. Even then, there are many pitfalls to the addition of the rural areas to the global marketplaces.Implications of Tech-saviourism and globalismNot the least of these would be the possibility of them falling prey to fore-mentioned imperialistic capitalism. Technology and growth must not substitute the liquor that we used to subjugate the tribal populace of this country. This is where a system thinking mindset comes into place, which envisions the future, warts, diseases, deaths and all. Understanding that every action will have domino effects that echo for centuries and designing solutions that are in line with our vision, bottom up and sustainable has thus been the need of the hour to climb THE slippery slope.Really bad metaphor for being sensitive to the contextInnovation has always seemed like a vague concept to me because of the plethora of contexts that it is used in. Even the first definition that I came across, “a new idea, device or method”, didn’t make complete sense to me. What helped here was the distinction between embodied and disembodied innovation. How embodied innovation had a physical device attached to the end of it, and how organizational innovation created a new conversation or implemented new ideas at a systemic level. The authors call for the disorganized frugal innovation sector to come together toward a vision. A systemic level intervention that uses organized frugal thinking to deploy reverse innovation or innovating down.The organization of the disorganized takes time. For a country that has not even begun to see the possible benefits of system-level thinking and transitional design, innovation after the due-diligence is fine. A feet-first dive gave us boon+bane of plastics in the first place. Innovation is ideally and most often incremental. As humanity develops its tree of knowledge further and further from the root, the more resources it takes to synthesize one level and move to the next. This may result in some (or lot) of hubris and that is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, systematic chaos is what defines us as a nation."

(2013). Worldly ethics: Democratic Politics and Care for the World (pp. 85-110). Duke University Press.      how do different authors approach care  Through reading Worldly ethics and how Ellla Myers has defined the way she is talking about care, I started to do two things, I have started to form an understanding of how different people set apart their notions of care.  Annemarie Mol for instance has approached it through the logics of practice. I need to read that in more detail, however, by bringing together a distinction that presupposes process in an established world she is different from Ella inasmuch as I have read. Ella sets it to be a worthy task to set up the world first. She defines the world of care in opposition to the self/other paradigm of care.  She also centers the actions of care and divides the concepts etymologically by separating the caring about and caring for. Is it possible to do this for marathi and malayalam.  \"dispositions, habits of mind, affective comportments, and felt commitments of its participants (and nonparticipants).\"          might be a good way to position how the \"worlds of care\"        Metrics of care              Attentiveness in passivity and activity is the way ella describes care. In the paper that I read talking about permeable heuristics of care(from ethicsofcare) the person spoke about precariousness and uncertainity. Paul seems to value accountability as way of understanding care. Shreyas seems to see continuity as the measure of care. Naveen brings the understanding of human fraility as well as ascribing value to human bodies. Annemarie Mol talks about care through human and nonhuman agency, specificity and in opposition to a casual notion of choice.    Care: relations and scales and logics    \"\"That is, although caring for oneself, others, and the world have something in common—signaled by the presence of the term care—they are far from identical or even mutually supportive activities.\"\" Here Ella Myers talks about care at three levels. yourselves, others and world. she contradicts herself in this \"\"The practitioner of such care is never a self but always an association of selves. Even more important, the recipient of care is not another person or even persons, but the world, understood as the array of material and immaterial conditions under which human beings live—both with one another and with a rich variety of nonhumans, organic and technological.\"\"  when she says that self exists within an associative world, which then asks the question is it yourselves, your others and your worlds. Does this mean that the logic of care runs through each of these? Also then as paul says, you can't care for the world if you don't care for yourself are these practices linked in some sort of way. And should I theorise on that  Another reference from Annemarie Mol \"Democratic care for the world, for example, though not unrelated to the fulfillment of people’s needs, may involve, paradoxically, displacing immediately vulnerable people from the center of analysis in order to bring into view and work to transform the complex environment out of which their needs arise.\"    worlds of care    Materiality and related violence    \"The world is not strictly tangible. Its materiality, what can be seen and touched, is never isolated from languages, relationships, norms, habits, and traditions, the more intangible elements of existence that overlie the physical.\" this could be tied into [[A Rape in Cyberspace]] and how the materialiaty of things is hardly proportional to its impact      Arendt makes the disctinction between man-made and natural, which myers doesn't. \"It is impossible to isolate the cultural from the natural without doing violence to reality\"    have to explore the connections between assemblages in Logic of Care and worlds here  The world, in short, should be understood as highly susceptible to human decision making and activity.  ### Assemblages of the world and nonhuman agencies          \"World displaces human beings from the center of analysis and brings into view a complex material and immaterial assemblage that is irreducible to human beings themselves. Although the world is never simply an inert background, it is the site and context of human action, among many other things. And worldly conditions, many of them produced, sustained, and altered by human actors, are nonetheless distinguishable from those actors themselves. Naming the world is important because it brings into focus a complex, heterogeneous entity that is distinct from any human being or collection of human beings.\"      \" when she says that self exists within an associative world, which then asks the question is it yourselves, your others and your worlds. Does this mean that the logic of care runs through each of these? Also then as paul says,you can't care for the world if you don't care for yourself are these practices linked in some sort of way. And should I theorise on that \" ### Agency of the worldly things and alll their futures   \"First, rather than thinking of the world as the focal point of democratic efforts, it is illuminating to consider the vast array of worldly things that have been and can become objects of political attention and advocacy.\" , she starts to address the non-objectivity of the world through the thing. she takes apart the notion of the subjective world seemingly because it is individualistic in nature. but as with lived experiences, the realities and worlds that we occupy are vastly different than some and similar to some. this same understanding of the world allows us to convalesce onto a \"thing\". The end might be the same for some but the paths vary according to realities and each of these is a singular and collective distinct world path            \"when those who are presently “uncounted” within a polity aim to publicly articulate a wrong to be re-dressed, they attempt to make themselves “of some account” by enacting a radical equality the social order denies (a scenario that, to Rancière, is definitive of democracy as such).\"      Read list  hannah arendt 'the human condition - amor mundi'          the telescope and human subjectivity    - Jacques Ranciere's theory of democracy        Quotes:              Theorists such as Connolly, Critchley, and Butler are right to insist that democratic practice is irreducible to formal structures of government; it is always shaped by the          dispositions, habits of mind, affective comportments, and felt commitments of its participants (and nonparticipants).    - Care for the world, distinct from concern for oneself or for an Other, is an ethos uniquely fit for democratic life.1    - The practitioner of such care is never a self but always an association of selves. Even more important, the recipient of care is not another person or even persons, but the world, understood as the array of material and immaterial conditions under which human beings live—both with one another and with a rich variety of nonhumans, organic and technological.    - More specifically still, coaction among citizens is directed not at the world per se but at particular worldly things that become objects of shared attention and concern. This thing, a concept that, like world, awaits full theorization, is crucial to every democratic undertaking. It is the third term—a practice, place, law, habit, or event— around which people gather, both in solidarity and division.    - supports and inspires mutual care for worldly conditions.    - giving of attention,    - expressed in action.    - caring about and caring for something.    - Hannah Arendt’s notion of amor mundi, or love of the world.    - the complex, extrasubjective “web”    - when people combine together to tend not to themselves but to the world in which they live.3    - care as intimate, suggesting both that care can be undertaken collectively by an association of actors and also that care can at times mean caring for objects and environments as well as people.8    - democratic mode of care, associative in character and oriented    - toward worldly things.    - That is, although caring for oneself, others, and the world have something in common—signaled by the presence of the term care—they are far from identical or even mutually supportive activities.    - Democratic care for the world, for example, though not unrelated to the fulfillment of people’s needs, may involve, paradoxically, displacing immediately vulnerable people from the center of analysis in order to bring into view and work to transform the complex environment out of which their needs arise.    - The world is not strictly tangible. Its materiality, what can be seen and touched, is never isolated from languages, relationships, norms, habits, and traditions, the more intangible elements of existence that overlie the physical.    - “The things that owe their existence exclusively to men nonetheless constantly condition their human makers.”16    - \"The world, in short, should be understood as highly susceptible to human decision making and activity. \"    - World displaces human beings from the center of analysis and brings into view a complex material and immaterial assemblage that is irreducible to human beings themselves. Although the world is never simply an inert background, it is the site and context of human action, among many other things. And worldly conditions, many of them produced, sustained, and altered by human actors, are nonetheless distinguishable from those actors themselves.20 Naming the world is important because it brings into focus a complex, heterogeneous entity that is distinct from any human being or collection of human beings.    - The focus of their attention, that “something” else, is a feature of the world. And, as Arendt points out, the world is “that about which we speak” when we address one another as citizens.22 The world, or rather some element of it, is the reason citizens struggle with and against each other.    - although the specific motivations and sentiments that inspire collective democratic action vary widely and produce outcomes that are uncertain, an underlying impulse, the “wish to change the world,” is shared by even the most divergent democratic actors.23    - “affair or matter of pertinence” that drew people together in delibera-tion, denoting what concerned human beings and was therefore a “matter for discourse.” The original meaning of thing as assembly and its later nam-ing of a “matter of pertinence” are a reminder that whether citizens are acting cooperatively on behalf of a shared goal or struggling against one another in pursuit of competing projects, their relations are mediated by the presence of a third term, a feature of the world that concerns or “bears upon” them.25 Worldly things, the objects of associative democratic action, are defined by three principal features: they are multiple, fluctuating, and con-tested.    - First, rather than thinking of the world as the focal point of demo-cratic efforts, it is illuminating to consider the vast array of worldly things that have been and can become objects of political attention and advocacy.    - a matter of fact—a relatively unproblematic feature of existence—is reconfigured as important,changeable, and demanding of public attention, that is, a matter of concern.    - collective organizing by ordinary citi-zens who seek to challenge existing arrangements as involving the “asser-tion of a common world.”30    - when those who are presently “uncounted” within a polity aim to publicly articulate a wrong to be re-dressed, they attempt to make themselves “of some account” by enacting a radical equality the social order denies (a scenario that, to Rancière, is definitive of democracy as such)."
