* Is [[Compost Magazine - Technofutures from Bidar]] a way of putting [[Capstone Extending]] into context
	* The co-authoring bit comes from archetypes of care
	* Archetypes come from the roles that people have played in collectives
	* Does this come closer to co-authoring as the only way a collective puts things out there?
		* what about the non-humans? Where do they feature
