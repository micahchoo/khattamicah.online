# variants
## introduction to variant architecture
-  so mutations happen on the spike proteins which are the spikey things that let a virus cell enter a cell within our bodies
- there are many processes through which it enters the cell
	- receptor bonding
	- s-protein cleavage by tmprss etc (if the spike protein breaks it is easier to enter the cell)

the single strand rna has 4 genes that control different functions of the virus
	-  Replications
	- proteases		
 - spike protein
 - other proteins
	 - envelop and hemosomething  
### lifecycle
entry into cell
genes make what they make
all of these go to golgi apparatus to vessicle(???)
eventually fuse with cell membrane then 
go and infect more cells


## B1.1.7 UK
N501y - substitution that changes compostiion of the spike protein and changes the struct of the Receptor binding domain
					- increases viral entry -> replication -> infection -> production -> transmission
HV69/70 - changes something that might interfere with the antibody binding to the spike protein
P618h - changes something in si and s2 parts of spike protein by increasing cleavage activity by TMPrss

## B.1.351 SA
N501y
E484k - increases interaction in the Receptor binding domain specifically motif -> which increases entry

## P.1
	N501y
	
## notes
- transmission may have increased 30 to 50%
- no idea what implications for mild and asymptomatic cases
- if the question is if i was vaccinated earlier how would the variants affect me?
	- then he thinks that memory b cells or tcells which are the cells that remember infections are still present through your vaccination even though there are changes in the spike protein

# [[how do vaccines work]]
-mRNA -> enters cell ->ribosome translation -> antigen presenting cells -> tcells releases cytokines which release more memory tcells and bcells-> bcells make plasma cells which make antibodies ->memory b cells have antibodies on their cell membrane and cytotoxic(?) tcells
therefore anticovid army = antibodies + memory b cells
cytotoxic t cells +memory t cells
- so even if antibodies don't bond with spike proteins thenother things are there
