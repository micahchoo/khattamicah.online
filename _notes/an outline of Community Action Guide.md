### Community-led research and expertise
- relies on its own local knowledge to identify an issue, think deeply about
it, and propose an answer.
- We do not have to feel powerless.
- reclaim control and identify our own priorities for development in our communities.
-  respects people and protects the environment.
-  a process where communities are empowered to define, lead, and carry out research on a topic of their choosing, and where everyone who participates is free to contribute, exchange, and reproduce the knowledge collected.
-  community builds on its local knowledge, customs, and traditions, and owns the knowledge that is being produced

### Role of Externals
#### Audiences
#### Allies
	- Facilitating the process, providing tips, or assisting in analyzing results, it is the community that leads the research and is in charge of making decisions.
	- The right to withdraw and hide statements
#### Influencers
	- Influencers could include project developers, financiers,media organizations, local officials, or other members of the government.  
#### Supporting Communities
	- seeking the advice and support of communities

### Risks
- If the risks are high, and participating in the research activities can
put people in great danger, you may want to explore alternative
methods. Security situations can change quickly, so you will want to
assess the situation continuously throughout the research process.
- Have a risk and mitigation process ready- for participants and researchers
- For example, in one community, authorities came to ask, “Who is the leader of the community’s research and campaign?” The community members did not give any specific name, and started calling every single member in the village “leader” after this incident, to avoid identification.

### Research Topic
- explain what community-led research is, and explain that it is up to the community to decide what to research, how to approach it, and what to do with the findings.

### Inclusion
- separate women-only or youth-only meetings.
- represent the diversity of the community.
	- how to identify diversity
- a proportionate balance between men and women.
- the research is actually **an exchange of information**, each team member should understand any community-led development plans and any development projects which are part of the research.
- train the team on how to conduct research

### Activities

		4.  possibilities from these
2. Externals
	1. Who is affected?
	2. Who is already working in this area?
	3. Who can influence the situation?
	4. Who are accessible research allies?
	5. Who can we work with?

### Data Collection
• Tell the participant who you are, which community you are from, or
which organization you are with
• Explain the purpose of the research - what the research is about and
why it is being conducted
• Explain how you are going to use the information given by them
• Explain that they have the right to anonymity and confidentiality, and
that they can withdraw their participation at any point during the research
process
• Ask if the participant has any questions before you start
• Ask if they want to participate in the research - this is called asking for
“informed consent”

### Community Engagement
- Set up a process to communicate the activities
and times when the community should gather for review and input.
1. At the very beginning of the process, share and confirm information
about the research team’s plans and goals with the wider community.
2. When the research process is ready to begin, share information
about how the research will be carried out.
3. Review the initial findings with the wider community before finalizing
or sharing the results publicly.
4. Ask the community to verify and analyze the findings, and to prioritize
the research that is most important for their objectives or campaign.
