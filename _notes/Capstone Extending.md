## Does it need to fit into a particular domain
	* Would domainifying this lead to its remediation

	* infrastructuring as meme - remediation in context 2	
## Paul's thoughts -

the first draft is hard to get out and I follow one of two approaches, gardening or planning or some hybrid. 
The writing process started off with a simple outline which I then followed with a graphic illustration of each of the section. This helped me sort out my metaphors and make a much more expanded outline.
