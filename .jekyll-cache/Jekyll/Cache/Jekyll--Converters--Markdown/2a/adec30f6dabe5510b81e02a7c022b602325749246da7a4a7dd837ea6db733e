I"ž<h2 id="hi-my-name-is-micah">Hi, My name is Micah</h2>
<p>I might be a designer. Or a researcher? or something else.</p>

<p>I hold on to different interests like #music, #movies, #videoessays, #linguisticidiosyncracies, #psychology, #philosophies, #fantasy, #science-fiction and many more. I would like to find a career that helps me borrow from all these places.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My dream is to be a great generalist, who keeps a team together, navigates complex situations and co-creates and co-realizes visions for an equitable and sustainable future.</p>
</blockquote>
