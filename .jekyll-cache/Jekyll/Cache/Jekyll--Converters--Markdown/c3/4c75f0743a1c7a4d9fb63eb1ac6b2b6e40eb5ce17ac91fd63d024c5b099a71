<p>the first draft is hard to get out and I follow one of two approaches, gardening or planning or some hybrid. 
The writing process started off with a simple outline which I then followed with a graphic illustration of each of the section. This helped me sort out my metaphors and make a much more expanded outline. 
After talking to shreyas, I decided to strucure it the way that I would, without academic boundaries. Is there a translation possible between the two?
Even then my outline is now based the questions, and that allows for a little bit of Non-Linear Storytelling</p>
